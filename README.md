# The Jupyter Repository for Linear Transformation Practices from Market Returns

![](banner.png)

## Introduction

This repository is being used for visualizing and calculating on Linear Regression with specifically determined on the part of using Eigendecomposition (both Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors) for calculating and visualizing the correlation, variances, covariances, and eigenvectors direction of ....

## Requirements

This repository is used in Python 3.11.5 in Jupyter Notebook framework with some significant libraries or packages that we need to additionally install in the code editor/PATH environment, which are:
1. Pandas
2. Matplotlib
3. Tensorflow Keras
4. Sklearn (Scikit Learn)
5. Seaborn
6. Numpy

## What's inside the repository

In this repository, we include lots of practices datasets even from books or external data from UCI (UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository) and Kaggle datasets. Additionally, we would like to drop the references below here and include the csv file inside our repository to look the data inside the datasets easily. Also, we put the code that we have done inside this repo to look up on the functions that we have use to train in Time Series prediction.
